## Description

Cutting Delight is a [Farmer's Delight][farmers-delight] addon that adds a new cutting board.

This cutting board makes it possible to select the output when cutting food. This is useful when using other [Farmer's Delight][farmers-delight] addons with conflicting recipes.

To do this, it opens a stone cutter-like menu where you can select what output you want.

## Getting Started

To start using this mod, create a [Farmer's Delight][farmers-delight] cutting board and put this in a item in your crafting menu. This will give you the custom cutting board.

You can put the item or tool on the cutting board like normal. The output menu opens when you right click with a tool on the cutting board and there is an item on the cutting board.

## Mod Loaders

Cutting Delight is currently only available for Neoforge, but modloader support can be expanded if it gets requested.

## Backports

After releasing version 1.0.0, I'm going to work on a Forge 1.20.1 version. I'm currently not planning on backporting this mod to earlier Minecraft/Farmer's Delight versions than 1.20.1, but if you want you can try it yourself and open a pull-request on my github repository.
